# PHP Unit Boilerplate

This is an empty project which only has a Sample class and a Unit Test for it.

I use this as a base for small tests.

## Requirements
PHP 7.2

## Install

```
> git clone git@github.com:fixwa/php-unit-boilerplate.git
> cd php-unit-boilerplate
> composer install
>  ./vendor/phpunit/phpunit/phpunit --no-configuration ./tests/
```
